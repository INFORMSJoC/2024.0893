## Description

This repository implements the limited adaptivity informative path planning algorithm found in our paper.

## Installing

Have a working installation of Python 3 and run the following command to install the dependencies.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Results

Figure 3 in the paper shows the average planning time and average relative cost per scenario for UAV search instances.

Figure 4 in the paper shows the average planning time and average relative cost per scenario for California road network instances.

## Replicating
The unprocessed results can be generated by running
```
python IPP/main.py -p ${problemid} -k ${nrounds}
```
where ```problemid``` ranges from 0-25 and ```nrounds``` ranges from 1-10.

The notebook ```results_analyzer.ipynb``` processes the output to generate the plots.
